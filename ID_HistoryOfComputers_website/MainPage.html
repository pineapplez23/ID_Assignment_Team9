                  Hi,welcome to our website! This website is made by Denzel Lee and Jia Hau from class T06.                 
                  The main purpose of our website is to teach you all about the history of computers. 
                  This journey would take you back all the way to
                  1936, where the first computer was invented, up to the present-day mordern computers. 
                </p>

        <div class = "learning">
          <h1> Learning Objectives</h1>
          <div class = "learning_content">
            <p>
              By the end of our website, users should be able to know more about the history about the first computer
              and the gradual progress from then all the way to where we are now. There would also be quiz right at the end 
              to test users' knowledge about what was just taught and provide a rough gauge to how much the user learnt.
