          <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
          <p>
            The first recorded use of the word "Computer" came in 1613.
            It was used to describe someone performing calculations and computations.
            The definition of Computer remained the same till the 19th century
            when humans realised that machines are never exhasted and can perform calculations
            faster and more accurate than a team of human "computers".

          <h2>First mechanical computer or automatic computing engine</h2>
          <p>
            The first concept of a mechanical computer or automatic computing engine was proposed by an English Mathematician, Charles Babbage.
            This lead to the creation of the first automatic computing engine, the Differnce Engine. It was capable of computing several
            sets of numbers and making hard copies of the results.
            Later in 1837, Charles Babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine.
            It contained an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), basic flow control, and integrated memory and is
            the first general-purpose computer concept. 
            However, due to lacks of funding for both proposals, Charles Babbage"s concept of the worlds first compueters
            were never created till a century later.

          <h2>Worlds First Programmable Computer</h2>
          <p>
              In 1936 to 1938, The Z1 was created by Germany's Konrad Zuse in his parents' living room
              and is considered to be the first electro-mechanical binary programmable 
              computer and widely considered as the worlds first functional computer.
              The machine measured 2 meters by 1.5 metres.

          <h2>The first electric programmable computer</h2>
          <p>
            As the second World War came, the British code breakers needed something to help in the
            decoding of encrypted German messages. Thus, in 1943, The Colossus was developed
            by Tommy Flowers, to serve this purpose.
            The Collossus occupied the size of a living room.
            It was 7ft (2.13m) high, 17ft (5.18m) wide and 11ft (3.35m) deep.

          <h2>Worlds First digital computers?</h2>
          <p>
            In the year 1937, Professor John Vincent Atanasoff and graduate student Cliff Berry
            started developing the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC). Its development would finish in 1942.
            The ABC was an electrical computer that used vacuum tubes for digital computation including
            binary math and Boolean logic and had no CPU. The ABC was discontinued when its founders left for WWII.

         <p>
           In 1943, in the University of Pennsylvania, The construction of the
           Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) began.
           Invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly in the United States,
           the ENIAC was a Government funded project for the army during the height of the second World War. 
           The Project was finished in the 1946 and the ENIAC occupied 
           1,800 square feet (167.23m^2) and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighing almost 50 tons (45359.2kg).
           The ENIAC was designed specifically for computing values for artillery range tables,
           however, a disadvantage came in the fact that it took days to rewire the machine for each new problem.
           Nevertheless, ENIAC still marks a huge step in technology and is widely considered as
           the world's first digital computer as it was more funtional than the ABC.
