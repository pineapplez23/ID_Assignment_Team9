          <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
          <p>
            The first recorded use of the word "Computer" came in 1613.
            It was used to describe someone performing calculations and computations.
            The definition of Computer remained the same till the 19th century
            when humans realised that machines are never exhasted and can perform calculations
            faster and more accurate than a team of human "computers".

          <h2>First mechanical computer or automatic computing engine</h2>
          <p>
            The first concept of a mechanical computer or automatic computing engine was proposed by an English Mathematician, Charles Babbage.
            This lead to the creation of the first automatic computing engine, the Differnce Engine. It was capable of computing several
            sets of numbers and making hard copies of the results.
            Later in 1837, Charles Babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine.
            It contained an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), basic flow control, and integrated memory and is
            the first general-purpose computer concept. 
            However, due to lacks of funding for both proposals, Charles Babbage"s concept of the worlds first compueters
            were never created till a century later.

          <h2>Worlds First Programmable Computer</h2>

              In 1936 to 1938, The Z1 was created by Germany's Konrad Zuse in his parents' living room
              and is considered to be the first electro-mechanical binary programmable 
              computer and widely considered as the worlds first functional computer.

          <p>
            As the second World War came, the British code breakers needed something to help in the
            decoding of encrypted German messages. Thus in 1943, The Colossus was developed
            by Tommy Flowers to serve this purpose.
            The Collossus occupied the size of a living room.
            It was 7ft (2.13m) high, 17ft (5.18m) wide and 11ft (3.35m) deep.

          <h2>Worlds First digital computers?</h2>
          <p>
            In the year 1937, Professor John Vincent Atanasoff and graduate student Cliff Berry
            started developing the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC). Its development would finish in 1942.
            The ABC was an electrical computer that used vacuum tubes for digital computation.
            The ABC was discontinued when its founders left for WWII. 
         </p>
         <p>
           In 1943, in the University of Pennsylvania, The construction of the
           Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) began.
           Invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly,
           the ENIAC was designed specifically for computing values for artillery range tables. 
           The Project was finished in the 1946 and it occupied 
           1,800 square feet (167.23m^2) and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighing almost 50 tons (45359.2kg).
           However, a disadvantage o fthe ENIAC came in the fact that it took days to rewire the machine for each new problem.
           Nevertheless, ENIAC still marks a huge step in technology and is widely considered as
           the world's first digital computer as it was more funtional than the ABC.

            The Next Step
          </h2>
          <p>
            After the invention of the ENIAC, J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly created a company
            called Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC) and began on their next big creation,
            The UNIVersal Automatic Computer I (UNIVAC I). It was designed as the first general-purpose
            electronic digital computer for business applications.
            UNIVAC I used about 5,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 16,686 pounds (7568.64 kg).
            On June 14, 1951, the first UNIVAC I computer was delivered to the U.S. Census Bureau.
            The Central Complex (the processor and memory unit) was 4.3 m by 2.4 m by 2.6 m high.
            The complete system occupied more than 35.5 m2 of floor space, a huge step up from the ENIAC.

          <h2>The Second Generation</h2>
          <p>
            The first generation of computers were made using vacuum tubes, which generated generated 
            large amounts of heat, were bulky and unreliable. Then came transistors,
            which replaced vacuum tubes in phone systems. So why not use them in computers?
            Thus, the construction of The TRADIC (TRAnsistor DIgital Computer or TRansistorized Airborne DIgital Computer),
            the world's first transistor computer, began. It was built by Jean Howard Felker of Bell Labs 
            with engineer L.C. Brown. In 1954, the TRADIC was complete.
            It occupied a tiny 3 cubic feet (0.0849505m3) and costed significantly less power to operate.
            It contained almost 800 point-contact transistors and 10,000 germanium crystal rectifiers
            and performed a million logical operations every second.

           The UNIX operating system (OS) produced by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and a group of other developers
           at Bell Labs, the same company that made the UNIVAC, and was released 3rd November 1971.
           UNIX had a multiuser, multitask system and is made up of 3 parts, The Kernel (The hub of the OS),
           The Shell (The interface) and its Programs. If this sounds familiar thats because a very popular O 
           used today in almost all devices, Linux, is a clone of UNIX. Differences between the 2 OSs mainly
           include that Linux is open sourced (can be used accessed by anyone) while UNIX is closed source
           (can only be accessed by its copyrighters) and that Linux is used by everyone everywhere while UNIX
           was developed mainly for servers, workstations and mainframes.

          <h2> Apple's First Computer</h2>
          <p>
           On April Fools day in 1976, a tiny company called Apple Computers INC was founded by 2 men 
           Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. They unveiled thier first computer the Apple I,
           the first computer with a single-circuit board and ROM (Read Only Memory).
           It was priced at USD$666.66(equivalent  to about USD$3,294.03 Today) as Wozniak liked the repeating numbers. Around 200 units were made.
           2 years later, the Apple II computer was presented at the Faire, which included color graphics
           and featured an audio cassette drive for storage. The computer retailed at USD$1,298 then
           (equivalent to around USD$5,597 today). Today, Apple is 1 of the worlds most successful companies
           worldwide, creating all types of tech produts and soon their own electric car!

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Not much occurs from 1979 to 1982. In 1983, The Apple LISA, standing for
            "Local Integrated Software Architecture" but also the name of Steve Jobs' daughter
            is the first personal computer to feature a GUI. The machine also had a drop-down menu and icons. 
            In that same year, the Gavilan SC invented by Manuel (Manny) Fernandez is released and is the
            first portable computer with a flip-form design and the very first to be sold as a "laptop".
            The next year during the annual Superbowl, The Apple Macintosh (Later called Mac in 1998)
            was shown to the world during an advertisement. It launched with a retail price of USD$2,500
            (around USD$6,764.87 today). In the November of 1985, in response to Apple LISA's GUI,
            Microsoft released the Operating system that 75% of the computers today use, Windows.
            Also in the same year, Steve Jobs left Apple after a long power struggle.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this sums up the first 50 years of Computer History
            From the huge 1,800 square feet (167.23m^2), 50 tons (45359.2kg) ENIAC,
            to the Apple I to the Gavilan SC, the world first Laptop.
