    <h1>1986-present</h1> 
    <h2>Smaller Faster</h2>
    <p>As the technologogy evoles, the main way forward is to pack as much tech into as little space as possible.
      Thus came Compaq. Founded by Rod Canion, Jim Harris, Bill Murto on Feb 16 1982, Compaq developed, sold,
      and supported computers, their related products and services. Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers,
      being the second company after Columbia Data Products to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer.
      In 1986, they beat IBM by releasing the first computer on the market to use Intel's new 80386 chip,
      a 32-bit microprocessor with 275,000 transistors on each chip, The Deskpro 386 System.

    <h2>The Internet</h2>
    <p>
      In March 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British researcher at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),
      submits his proposal for what would become the World Wide Web. His paper details his ideas for
      Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), the building blocks of the Web. Later in November of the same year,
      the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet was implemented.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Linux</h2>
    <p>
      In 1991, Finnish university student Linus Torvalds, designed the Linux kernel and released it to
      several Usenet newsgroups. Almost immediately, enthusiasts began developing and improving it,
      adding support and improving stability. In February 1992, Linux became free software or,
      as its developers preferred to say after 1998, “open source”.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Digital Video Disc (DVD)</h2>
    <p>
      DVDs were introduced in 1995 after a competiton between 2 mainly Japenese technology companies,
      IBM initiated a working group of technology experts that brokered the competition.
      After compromises from both sides, the DVD format was formalized. 
      DVDs came in both read-only and read-write formats, and were widely adopted in the film industry
      for consumer releases of movies. Its better audio and video quality, interactivity,
      and improved lifespan effectively rendered the VHS format obsolete.
      Its successor is the Blu-ray disc.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Google</h2>
    <p>
    In 1996, 2 students at the Stanford University Sergey Brin and Larry Page began on a project
    that lead to the creation of BackRub. Why BackRub you might ask? According to its creaters,
    they called it this because the program analyzed the web's “back links” to understand
    how important a website was, and what other sites it related to. BackRub would then go on to
    become the most visited website of the world today, Google.
    </p>
    <h2>Visual Studio</h2>
    <p>
      In 1997, Microsoft introduces Visual Studio. Bundled along with it came a lot of programming tools.
      Microsoft's intent was to create a single environment where developers could use different programming languages. 
      The idea of visual programming is to allow programmers to develop software using built-in visual elements (like in a block diagram) instead of text.
      In the present day, Visual studio is used by programmers to create mobile apps, websites, 
      computer programmes, web apps and webservices.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>The IMac</h2>
    <p>
      A combination of the last few years of Macintosh technologogy from Apple, the IMac had a huge ripple in the 
      business. Buyers got a machine with a 233-MHz G3 processor, 4GB hard drive, 32MB of RAM,
      a CD-ROM drive, and a 15" monitor. The IMac was noted for how easy it was to use. 
      A 'manual' that contained only a few pictures and less than 20 words was included with the purchase.
      This was Apple's first product with the return of Steve Jobs, reviving apple from near bankruptcy. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Wi-Fi</h2>
    <p>
      In 1999, the growing IEEE 802.11b short-range radio networking standard 
      was rebranded to “Wi-Fi” by the Wi-Fi Alliance. Apple jumped in and took a piece of the Wi-Fi pie
      by releasing the "Airport" Wi-Fi router, allowing Macs to recieve Wi-Fi. As time went on, 
      the popularity of Wi-Fi grew exponentially and soon, it was everywhere.
    </p>
    <h2>USB Flash Drive</h2>
    <p>
      Along with the turn of the new century, new improvements in technology came. 
      The USB Flash Drive was introduced to the world. The first USB Drive was sold here in
      Singapore by a company named Trek 2000. They could be used for data storage and in the
      backing up and transferring of files between various devices. Drives for floppy disks and optical discs faded in
      popularity for desktop PCs and laptops in favor of USB ports after flash drives were introduced.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Power Mac</h2>
    <p>
      The first true 64-bit personal computer, the Apple G5 is the most powerful Macintosh ever
      released to that point. With a hard aluminium case, the Apple G5 was released in 2003.
      later that year, more than a thousand Apple G5s were used to create the System X cluster supercomputer,
      rated #3 in November of that year on the world's TOP500 fastest computers.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>First IPhone</h2>
    <p>
      In 2007, the first Iphone with a 3.5 inch LCD screen, a single 2 mega pixel (mp) camera and up to 16Gb of internal storage,
      It brought about the world of mobile phones to the public. A far cry from the 6 inch QHD+, 108 mp camera
      and up to over 500 Gb of expandable storage. Still, it was a huge step for technology as the IPhone was
      very portable and right fully so, it took the world by storm then.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Macbook Air</h2>
    <p>
      The very next year, Apple introduces their first ultra notebook. A light, thin laptop with high-capacity battery.
      The Air incorporated many of the technologies that had been associated with Apple's MacBook line of laptops,
      including integrated camera, and Wi-Fi capabilities. The Macbook line would then become one of Apples most successful lines.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>IBM's RoadRunner supercomputer</h2>
    <p>
      In 2009, the Roadrunner is the first computer to reach a sustained performance of 1 petaflop
      (one thousand trillion floating point operations per second). It used two different microprocessors:
      an IBM POWER XCell L8i and AMD Opteron. It was used to model the decay of the US nuclear arsenal,
      analyze financial data, and render 3D medical images in real-time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>The IPad</h2>
    <p>
      The iPad combines many of the popular capabilities of the iPhone, such as built-in high-definition camera,
      access to the iTunes Store, and audio-video capabilities, but with a nine-inch screen and without the phone.
      Apps, games, and accessories helped spur the popularity of the iPad.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>The Raspberry pie</h2>
    <p>
      As a Child born in 2000s, ive had my fair share of this device. A credit card sized 
      computer features ease of use and simplicity and introduced code to many children of any age.
      In October 2013, the one millionth Raspberry Pi was shipped. Only one month later, 
      another one million Raspberry Pis were delivered. The Pi weighed only 45 grams and initially sold for only $25-$35 U.S. Dollars.

    <br>
    <h2>html 5</h2>
    <p>
      In 2014, HTML 5 is announced as the successor to HTML 4, which had become the standard for web markup languages in 1997.
      Markup languages describe how web pages will look and function. Work on HTML 5 had begun in 2004 under the auspices of the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group.
      It was simplified compared to its predecessors and was intended to be human-readable. HLTML 5 also offered a number of improvements for multimedia,
      such as simplifying the embedding of content such as streaming video and games into web pages.

    <h2>Computers now</h2>
    <p>
      From 2016 to now not much ahs really stirred up the tech world computers wise.
      Besides the annual improves to Specs and hardware, not many major jumps have been taken.
      Overall, the improvements of technology has seemingly slowed down from the early 2000s.
      but it shows no signs of stopping as there is no end to what we can do with tech.
      Could this be the peak of technology in our households? Who knows? Maybe someday you could ask
      your Alexa or google home or use an app on oyur phone to bring you food from your fridge via drone!
      All we can do is to look towards the future and wait!
