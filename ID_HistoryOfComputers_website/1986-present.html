        <h2>Smaller Faster</h2>
        <p>As the technologogy evoles, the main way forward is to pack as much tech into as little space as possible.
          Thus came Compaq. Founded by Rod Canion, Jim Harris, Bill Murto on Feb 16 1982, Compaq developed, sold,
          and supported computers, their related products and services. Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers,
          being the second company after Columbia Data Products to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer.
          In 1986, they beat IBM by releasing the first computer on the market to use Intel's new 80386 chip,
          a 32-bit microprocessor with 275,000 transistors on each chip, The Deskpro 386 System.

        <h2>The Internet</h2>
        <p>
            In March 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British researcher at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),
            submits his proposal for what would become the World Wide Web. His paper details his ideas for
            Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), the building blocks of the Web. Later in November of the same year,
            the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet was implemented.

        <p>
            In 1991, Finnish university student Linus Torvalds, designed the Linux kernel and released it to
            several Usenet newsgroups. Almost immediately, enthusiasts began developing and improving it,
            adding support and improving stability. In February 1992, Linux became free software or,
            as its developers preferred to say after 1998, “open source”.

        <h2>Digital Video Disc (DVD)</h2>
        <p>
            DVDs were introduced in 1995 after a competiton between 2 mainly Japenese technology companies,
            IBM initiated a working group of technology experts that brokered the competition.
            After compromises from both sides, the DVD format was formalized. 
            DVDs came in both read-only and read-write formats, and were widely adopted in the film industry
            for consumer releases of movies. Its better audio and video quality, interactivity,
            and improved lifespan effectively rendered the VHS format obsolete.
            Its successor is the Blu-ray disc.

          In 1996, 2 students at the Stanford University Sergey Brin and Larry Page began on a project
          that lead to the creation of BackRub. Why BackRub you might ask? According to its creaters,
          they called it this because the program analyzed the web's “back links” to understand
          how important a website was, and what other sites it related to. BackRub would then go on to
          become the most visited website of the world today, Google.

        <p>
          In 1997, Microsoft introduces Visual Studio. Bundled along with it came a lot of programming tools.
          Microsoft's intent was to create a single environment where developers could use different programming languages. 
          The idea of visual programming is to allow programmers to develop software using built-in visual elements (like in a block diagram) instead of text.
          In the present day, Visual studio is used by programmers to create mobile apps, websites, 
          computer programmes, web apps and webservices.

          A combination of the last few years of Macintosh technologogy from Apple, the IMac had a huge ripple in the 
          business. Buyers got a machine with a 233-MHz G3 processor, 4GB hard drive, 32MB of RAM,
          a CD-ROM drive, and a 15" monitor. The IMac was noted for how easy it was to use. 
          A 'manual' that contained only a few pictures and less than 20 words was included with the purchase.
          This was Apple's first product with the return of Steve Jobs, reviving apple from near bankruptcy.

          was rebranded to “Wi-Fi” by the Wi-Fi Alliance. Apple jumped in and took a piece of the Wi-Fi pie
          by releasing the "Airport" Wi-Fi router, allowing Macs to recieve Wi-Fi. As time went on, 
          the popularity of Wi-Fi grew exponentially and soon, it was everywhere.

          It was simplified compared to its predecessors and was intended to be human-readable. HLTML 5 also offered a number of improvements for multimedia,
